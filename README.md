## Features in Detail

### 1. Real-time Validation

The form provides real-time validation for each field as users interact with the form. Invalid inputs will be highlighted and the user is notified immediately about the error.

### 2. Password Strength Indicator

The password field has an integrated strength indicator, which checks for basic criteria like length, uppercase letters, and digits to determine if the password is weak, medium, or strong.

### 3. Profile Picture Preview

Users can upload their profile picture, and the selected image will be previewed immediately after the file is chosen. This feature is implemented using JavaScriptâ€™s `FileReader` API.

### 4. Error Summary

If there are any errors in the form, they will be summarized at the top of the form in an error summary list. This ensures users can easily review and correct their mistakes.

### 5. Responsive Design

The form layout adjusts automatically for different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

## Example Usage

### Password Strength Indicator Example

- **Weak**: Passwords shorter than 6 characters will be flagged as "Weak".
- **Medium**: Passwords that are 6 characters or longer but do not contain both uppercase and digits will show a "Medium" strength.
- **Strong**: Passwords that meet the criteria of being at least 6 characters long, with uppercase letters and digits, are flagged as "Strong".

### Profile Picture Example

- The user uploads a picture, and a preview will appear below the file input field. Only JPEG, PNG, and GIF files are accepted.
